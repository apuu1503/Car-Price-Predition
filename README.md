```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask (for the web interface)
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib (for saving and loading the model)

## Usage

1. **Run the Web Application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
   
2. **Access the Interface**:
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.
